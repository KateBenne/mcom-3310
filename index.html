<p>The best way to describe HTML to someone who is unfamiliar with it is to consider it its own language as it has its own grammatical structure and syntax. 
HTML is a markup language that lets you identify common webpage sections such as headings, body paragraphs, and lists. Many elements of HTML help you 
build the structure of webpage content and can determine how it will be displayed.</p>

<p>HTML is important because it is the building block for designing a webpage. Most people see a completed webpage and may appreciate the way it looks, but few
really understand how it is created. Once you are able to understand basic HTML, the possibility of creating whatever type of webpage you want becomes
much more realistic.</p>

<p> HTML can include hyperlinks that take you to your favorite websites, like this one <a href=https://www.premierleague.com/>here!</a> HTML is a super useful tool that becomes easier the more you use it. <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/> This </a> is a great source for all HTML information! </p>
